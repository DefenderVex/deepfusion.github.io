inseparable from the day they were born, even more so after both their parents will killed in the car crash at the age of five. The two would</br>
later be adopted by Alexander & Jasmine Drake a year later. The two would continue to reside in Australia until the age of fourteen when they both</br>
decide to change their last names to Drake before moving to the United States with their adoptive parents in search of a fresh start.</br>

After the four of them settled down in los Angeles California, Oliver & Tyler both took up surfing but over time Oliver became more interested in</br>
motosports. On his sixteenth birthday Oliver's adoptive parents got him a dirt bike which marked the start of his interest on a profressional</br>
level. Over the coming years he practiced and trained for national championships, by the age of twenty he was the winner of the AMA Motocross</br>
Championship twice where he gained the reputation for being an incredibly gifted rider.</br>

way back to each other in the coming weeks but only time will tell.</br>
